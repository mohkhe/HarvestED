# HarvestED
HarvestED is a browser-based harvester which enables focused web harvesting through employing a number of different query generation mechanisms to expand given queries. HarvestED can overcome limitations imposed by search engines on the number of returned results or number of query submissions. 

### Our goal
To achieve their goals, organizations, individuals and devices alike need to be aware of key players, events and attitudes in the world around them that may affect them or their interests. This is true for many parties:

* for financial organizations surviving in an unstable economic environment;
* for governmental organizations with responsibilities to monitor open sources;
* for knowledge-intensive companies tapping into the collective wisdom of their employees;
* for an individual aiming to engage in cultural activities.

### Authors and Contributors
HarvestED is funded by the Dutch national program **COMMIT/**. We, in Database group of University of Twente, developed a focused web harvester as a result of _Infiniti_ (INFORMATION RETRIEVAL FOR INFORMATION SERVICES) project.
